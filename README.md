### Description

This assignment is a rework of our portfolio using the React framework in place of static front-end files. I used our homework 2 assignment (personal github page) as the base for this, with the content re-worked just a bit to accommodate both career services feedback on the page as well as the parameters for this project (specifically having each portfolio item display dynamically rather than on one long continuous page).

This will improve the user experience when viewing my profile and portfolio, and will not give me limitations on the content I can share on my portfolio since only one project will be stored at a time.

####Deployment:

This application will allow colleagues to see a wide range of the body of work that I have completed at the UNC Bootcamp, how I've grown as a developer over the last several months, and a bit into me as a person as well on the "About Me" page (including demonstrating my proficiency using APIs in react with Axios, while giving everyone a window of what music I've been listening to lately).

I display my best work here and have every major category shown that was covered during the Bootcamp; including front-end, back-end, and full-stack assignments.
